# Part 5: Modify client code to interact with smart contract

------

Create the frontend that allows your users to interact with your DApp. This should be a simple and clean frontend that manages product lifecycle as the product navigates down the supply chain.

Using javascript, create a single JS file with all web3 functions that allows your client code to interact with you smart contracts.

The coffee example in the boilerplate provides this code for you.

# Requirement: Configure client code for each actor

------

Front-end is configured to:

- 1) Submit a product for shipment (farmer to the distributor, distributor to retailer, etc).
- 2) Receive product from shipment.
- 3) Validate the authenticity of the product.

Frontend code can be downloaded and executed from a local environment.
