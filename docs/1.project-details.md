# Project Details

------

For this project, you will creating a DApp supply chain solution backed by the Ethereum platform. You will architect smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a product’s authenticity.

To help you develop such a DApp, we’ve outlined the parts needed below. We will cover these parts in the remainder of this project lesson. There is an *optional section if you would like an extra challenge, but note this is not required for the project to pass.*

> | **Part 1**   | Plan the project with write-ups                           |
> | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Part 2**   | Write smart contracts                                     |
> | **Part 3**   | Test smart contract code coverage                         |
> | **Part 4**   | Deploy smart contracts on a public test network (Rinkeby) |
> | **Part 5**   | Modify client code to interact with smart contracts       |
> | **Optional** | Implement Infura to store product image                   |
