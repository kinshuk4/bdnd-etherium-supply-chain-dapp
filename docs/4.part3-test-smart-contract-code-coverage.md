------

# Requirement: Smart contract has associated tests

For this project, as with any project, make sure to test your smart contracts to ensure they are working properly in different situations without any risk.

# Requirement: Smart contract has associated tests

------

At minimum, test every function for every function you implemented from your Sequence Diagram. For example, from this Sequence Diagram we would need to test 10 functions:

- harvestItem()
- processItem()
- packItem()
- addItem()
- buyItem()
- shiptItem()
- receiveItem()
- purchaseItem()
- fetchItemBufferOne()
- fetchItemBufferTwo()
