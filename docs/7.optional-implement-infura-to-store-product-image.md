# Optional: Implement Infura to store product image

------

**NOTE:** This section is not required for your project to pass. These steps are purely optional and a way for you to expand on your project.

Using your previous coursework experience, modify your DApp to allow the initial producer in the supply chain to upload an image of the product along with the UPC hash and store this image using Infura.

Consider including 2 methods - upload() and read()
