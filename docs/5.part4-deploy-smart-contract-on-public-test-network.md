## Part 4: Deploy smart contracts on public test network

Once your smart contract is created, itâ€™s time to go live! For this project, deploy your smart contract on the Ethereum *RINKEBY* test network.

# Requirement 1: Deploy smart contract on a public test network

------

Using Truffle framework, deploy your smart contract with the Rinkeby test network. Take note of your contract hash and address after successful deployment.

*Tip: Refer to Infura screencast for assistance on deploying your smart contract with Infura and Truffle.*

# Requirement 2: Submit Contract Address

------

Provide a document with your project submission that includes the contract address.

Document for your project must be in either ".txt" or ".md" format.

*Hint:* You can view the Contract address using a blockchain explorer (e.g. Etherscan).
